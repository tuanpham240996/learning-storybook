### Run your local learning-storybook server
```
$ yarn
$ npm run storybook
```
This compiles your code to a temporary directory and serves it here: [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/)

### Write your story

Regardless if you are creating a new component or updating an existing component in project, check the corresponding story in the /stories/stories folder.

If there isn't a story yet, create a new one with the .stories.js extension.

While the server is running, code is automatically linted and watched for changes. Changes will appear in your browser automatically.
